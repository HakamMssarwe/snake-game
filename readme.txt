I created this game to test my Javascript progress and practice abit, it was actually fun.

Notes: I Haven't watched any tutorials or use any guide, the only thing I searched for is the collision part with the bait meets with the head (late at night and too tired :*).

//Collision logic:
If all of following are true than our first rectangle (A) is colliding with our second rectangle (B).
A.X < B.X + B.Width
A.X + A.Width > B.X
A.Y < B.Y + B.Height
A.Y + A.Height > B.Y

What did I learn from this?

- We as humans are limited, therefore we have to put our trust in god and ask for help <3 (yes even in code, that's how I solve most of the problems anyway :) )
- Don't over complicate the problems, sometimes its easier than you think.
- Don't convince yourself it's over, another problem will rise! aha :)
- Sometimes you have to rewrite the code and start over again.


Source code written by Hakam <3 have fun !
